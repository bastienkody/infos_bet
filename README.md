## Max cote
A file ".max_cote_infos_bet.txt" is needed in home repo (~/)

It stores infos in format "sportname=yx.xx" (x and y digits, y is optional)

## Outfile
In launch.sh, assign the outfile variable

ie: `outfile=result.txt` for result.txt as outfile

ie: `outfile=/dev/stdout` for terminal screen (no outfile)

## Start the script 
`./launch.sh`
